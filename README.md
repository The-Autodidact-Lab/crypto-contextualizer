JACK -- LIT REVIEW:
- [Google: CoA](https://research.google/blog/chain-of-agents-large-language-models-collaborating-on-long-context-tasks/)
    - Very raw, more focussed on long-context than sharing information; traditional text-based information sharing
    - Orchestrator ("manager") and worker agents to parse chunks
    - Independence vs. shared knowledge: it's helpful for agents to be able to explore independently, but they need to be able to forward/share info
